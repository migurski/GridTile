In TileCache/Layers/UTMGrid.py, you will find a TileCache layer class that does
nothing but draw UTM-based grids on transparent tiles, suitable for layering
with other maps.

example-8-76-114.png is an example output tile, and can be overlaid on the
corresponding http://tile.openstreetmap.org/8/76/114.png.

    spacing=128
    
    # length of 1/10 tick marks in pixels.
